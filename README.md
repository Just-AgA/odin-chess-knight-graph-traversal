This is a simple project where we will simulate a graph traversal using BFS for the knight chess piece.

Focusing on the chess rules and the moveset of the knight,we will create a function that will give the shortest path traversed by the knight if we give a start position and an end position.

In the end the total amount of moves and the list of moves in between the start and end positions will be printed in the console.
